# Deploy a log monitoring system

**Disclaimer: This is a challenge project that is not meant to be used in production!**

## Project steps

1. Setup K8s cluster on https://cloud.digitalocean.com/
2. Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana to store and browse logs
3. Deploy FluentBit to collects and push logs to Eelasticsearch

### Setup K8s cluster

Create an account on DigitalOcean and follow instruction on UI to create Kubernetes cluster. The process of creating a cluster is pretty straight forward, I've created a cluster with 2 nodes, it should be more than enough for this challenge.

### Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana

I used Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) for this and followed quick start guide which you can find here https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-quickstart.html

First we need to install custom CRDs and the operator:

```
kubectl create -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/1.9.1/crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/1.9.1/operator.yaml
```

I can see that operator is up and running.

Next, deploy Elasticsearch cluster. You can check my manifests in the repo, there is the command to apply it:

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/elasticsearch.yaml
```

After a few seconds, Elasticsearch should be running in `default` namespace.

Let's check if it works by sending a request. Before doing so, I need to port-forward my local port to K8s Elasticsearch port.

And finally send a reqeust.

Yup, so far so good. ðŸ‘Œ

Let's move on by deploying Kibana:

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/kibana.yaml
```

Then, let's do port forwarding again:

And now I'm able to access Kibana from my browser.

### Deploy FluentBit

In the last step, I used Helm to deploy FluentBit, you can check chart values at `packages/fluent-bit-values.yaml`. The important part here is output configuration, to allow FluentBit to push logs to Elasticsearch:

```yaml
  outputs: |
    [OUTPUT]
        Name es
        Match kube.*
        Host quickstart-es-http
        Logstash_Format On
        Retry_Limit False
        HTTP_User elastic
        HTTP_Passwd 6byJ6IfOYgyLZ8m472cg2926
        tls On
        tls.verify Off
```

Now it's time to install FluentBit:

```
helm install fluent-bit fluent/fluent-bit -f packages/fluent-bit-values.yaml
```

After a few seconds, I see that FluentBit successfully installed and is running on both nodes as a DaemonSet.

When opening Kibana, I can see that logs are successfully being pushed to Elasticsearch.
